# IonicImageSliderExample

An example of an image slider on Ionic for comparing two images.

It uses the juxtaposejs library.

Downloaded the css and js from the site into the assets folder.
 
Added those assets to the index.html file before the polyfills.js

Look at the home.ts and home.html for the implementation.
